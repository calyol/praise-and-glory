# Welcome

This is a non-denominational Christian Bible study. The author uses the New International Version (NIV) or New King James Version (NKJV) when developing these studies. If you do not have a NIV or NKJV Bible, you can find one online:

[Bible Gateway](https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/) 

[Bible Study Tools](https://www.biblestudytools.com/bible-versions/)


# Studies

There are year-long studies for you to choose. Each study has a topic for every month of the year. There are Bible verses for each week of the month. 

*Even though these studies were written in years past, do not hesitate to (re)visit them as often as you feel led to do so.*
