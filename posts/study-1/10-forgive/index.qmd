Forgiveness is a choice and a process. We have to choose to forgive if we want to be forgiven by our heavenly father. When we choose to forgive, the sometimes long process of restoring begins. By the power of the Holy Spirit, we extend the same grace and mercy that has been extended to us.  As time moves on, we will find that the hurt and pain that was caused has lessened. Our hearts and minds are free towards the person and can focus on God.
