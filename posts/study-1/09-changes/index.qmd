Fall is a season that often appears to have the most drastic physical changes. The leaves on trees turn beautiful colors and, then, fall to the ground; we gather and dispose of them. This could also be a time to make changes in our attitude and outlook. Letting some things “fall away” or change. GOD wants us to 'fall' into His word and allow it to visibly and spiritually change us.
