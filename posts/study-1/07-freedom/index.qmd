"Freedom" is a word that invokes many emotions, depending on your circumstances. We should all strive to have freedom from fear, harmful thoughts and worry. Christâ€™s death on the cross guarantees us freedom from all of these things and more.

Once we accept Jesus as our savior, we are saved and free. True freedom comes from walking with Him. My hope is that we tap into the freedom that only Jesus gives!
