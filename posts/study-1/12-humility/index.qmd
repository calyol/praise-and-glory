As I reflect on the year and this season, the word "humility" captures the posture of my heart. I am humbled that the Lord allowed me to see another calendar year. I am awed and amazed by the story of the birth of Christ (never gets old) and the joy in the atmosphere! I am humbled by the willingness of strangers to share with one another. I am so thankful for Jesus who humbled Himself to save us.
