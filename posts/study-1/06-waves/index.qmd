At times, it seems like our lives move in waves. Waves of hope, sorrow, fear, joy and peace.  No matter which waves we are riding, GOD is present. During our seasons of riding whichever wave life gives us, we must remember to keep our eyes on the Lord. He can and will keep us in his care through the waves of life.
