As believers in CHRIST, our goal should be to increase in knowledge and spiritual growth. Getting older usually comes with experiences that produce growth: We begin to look at events and issues through a different lens. I pray that the lens we see life through will increase our spiritual knowledge.

Meditate on these verses to gain wisdom:
