Rest is something we all need. There are different types of rest. Physical rest is what our bodies need to function properly. Mental rest is what we need to stop overthinking in lifeâ€™s circumstances. Spiritual rest is what we need to do when we are trying to fix things. Only the LORD can fix situations and circumstances. May we rest in HIM!
