"Understanding" means for one to gain insight from the information they read, see and hear. This is a gift from GOD. Being able to obtain understanding as it relates to the word of GOD is helpful. It allows us to navigate our journey. I pray for understanding as we study GODâ€™s word.

Meditate on these verses to gain wisdom:

-   Week 1
    -   Psalms  119:99-100
-   Week 2
    -   Job 26:14
-   Week 3
    -   Acts 28:26-27
-   Week 4
    -   Ephesians 5:15-17
