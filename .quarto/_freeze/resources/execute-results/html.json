However, using unordered list HTML tag with Markdown list has the designed result to make a left-aligned, bulleted list.\n\n- See Quarto [Tips & Tricks](https://www.productive-r-workflow.com/quarto-tricks) from Yan Holtz. \n  - One of the tips includes HTML code for adding a button.\n  \n- [Emojis](https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/content.html#emojis) can be added in Quarto, if you are using the visual editor.\n\n- See this [StackOverflow forum](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74100418/inline-images-in-quarto-markdown) about adding inline images in {revealjs} slides.\n\n- See this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions/9957) to learn additional YAML options for the listing page!\n\n-  Mine Cetinkaya had a 2022 [website](https://mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/quarto-tip-a-day/) with daily Quarto tips.\n",
