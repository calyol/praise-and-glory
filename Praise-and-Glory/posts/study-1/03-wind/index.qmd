Wind is unseen but felt. Wind can cause blizzards, hurricanes or tornadoes. It can also bring relief on a hot summer day.
Wind provides a wonderful way for sails on a boat to move or a balloon to take you up into the sky. Life can be like the wind: bitter and sweet. Trust GOD no matter where the wind takes you.
