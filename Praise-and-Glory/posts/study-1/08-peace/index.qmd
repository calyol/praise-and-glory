Peace is precious and cannot be bought. We as a society look for peace in things and places. These places and things include bars, gyms, cars, food and, hopefully, church. True peace can only be found in Jesus Christ! His word tells us to seek Him and He will give us peace in every area of our lives. May we seek and obtain the peace that only GOD gives.
