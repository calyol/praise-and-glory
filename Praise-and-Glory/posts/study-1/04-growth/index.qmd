Spring issues in a season of new growth and warmth after a cold winter. The cold allows us time to stay indoors: listen to the Holy Spirit, develop new ideas and begin the process for new growth. New growth can occur in many ways. It can occur by changing habits, learning a new skill, teaching a bible study, or taking a class and other things. Seek GOD and ask Him for ways to produce new growth in you.
