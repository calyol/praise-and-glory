At some point in everyone’s life, we seek justice and provide justice. Justice comes in many forms. It can be simple or complex. Simple justice may look like fixing some you broke. Complex justice can look like fixing something that is broken and restoring all parties involved. GOD’s justice is simple and complex. Complex because he sent His only son to die for our sins. Simple because we just need to receive it.
