The word of GOD tells us that GOD’s mercy never ends. I’ve found that most of us appreciate this when it applies to us. But, we dislike this when it comes to those that have hurt us. GOD commands us to love one another as He loves us. A part of loving someone is to extend mercy in situations where it’s needed, even when it’s not requested. Thank you, Lord, for mercy: May we extend it to others as you do (have) to us.
